# Reference Notes

The `Reference/` directory holds evergreen notes — living documents that are continuously updated and referenced over time. The content should stay current.

## File Naming

Use clear, descriptive Title Case. No date prefix — the date isn't the point for evergreen content.

Examples:
- `Reliability Observability.md`
- `Agent Loop Trace.md`
- `Telemetry and Privacy Mode Audit Report.md`

## Frontmatter

Every reference note should have `tags` and optionally `last-updated`:

```yaml
---
tags: [observability, reliability]
last-updated: 2026-02-06
---
```

Update `last-updated` whenever you make meaningful changes to the note.

## Content

- Keep information current — if something is outdated, update or remove it
- Use headings and structure generously — people come back to these repeatedly
- Use a table of contents for notes longer than ~5 sections
- Use wikilinks (`[[Note Name]]`) to connect to related notes
- Tags for cross-cutting themes (`#observability`, `#ide`, etc.)

## When to Archive

If a reference note becomes obsolete and no longer gets updated, consider moving it to `Log/` with a date prefix reflecting when it was last relevant.
