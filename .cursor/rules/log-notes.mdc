# Log Notes

The `Log/` directory holds time-oriented notes — meetings, one-off thoughts, investigations, and anything anchored to a specific moment. These are snapshots, not living documents.

## File Naming

Always use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD - Descriptive Title.md`

Examples:
- `2026-02-06 - Meeting With Alexey - Cloud Debug Mode.md`
- `2026-02-05 - Meeting With Noor - Reliability Observability.md`
- `2026-02-04 - HTTP1 vs HTTP2 Agent Transport Investigation.md`

The ISO date prefix ensures correct chronological sorting in the Obsidian sidebar.

## Detecting Meetings

If the user's input or note content contains phrases like "chat with", "meeting with", "talked to", "synced with", "1:1 with", or similar, treat it as a meeting note. The title should follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD - Meeting With <Person> - <Topic>.md`. The person's name belongs in the title so it's visible in the sidebar.

## Frontmatter

Every log note should have `date` and `tags`:

```yaml
---
date: 2026-02-06
tags: [observability, sentry]
---
```

## Content

- Can be rough and unpolished — these are working notes, not docs
- No expectation of future updates — if you find yourself updating a log note repeatedly, it should be promoted to `Reference/`
- Use wikilinks (`[[Note Name]]`) to connect to related notes

## When to Promote

If a log note evolves into something that gets continuously updated or referenced, move it to `Reference/` and drop the date prefix from the title.
