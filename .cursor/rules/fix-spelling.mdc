# Fix Spelling

When capturing the user's words into notes, todos, or ideas, fix obvious typos and spelling mistakes. The user's intent matters, not their keystrokes. Keep their voice and phrasing — just correct the spelling.

Examples:
- "prviacy" → "privacy"
- "sanitiatin" → "sanitization"
- "paralell" → "parallel"
- "convesration" → "conversation"
